## Planning

Unsolved threads

- Elidee was recognized by the landlord
- Dragon egg still healthy. Not warmer than before.

Ideas from the clan

- Rircin find contact
    - Find the son of [mave]
- Elidee
    + Talk to the landlord and ask about her mother
+ Norman
    * Is a wanted person, so he should thread carfully
+ Xairan
    * See if he can find info. Infiltrate the military.

Before leaving

- People should hide their weapons or carry small weapons
- Check house for traps?
- Buy metal for the forge. Stuff

## Campaing

People are going shopping

There are people carrying weapons wearing blue and green. Similar to the guard that was sent


### Rircin and Urist look for metals

They went following the track on Arno??.

Walled yard with heavy doors. Some things are rusted and others aren't. There are a bunch of bricks laying around. Building scaffolding

Rircin and Urist talk to the scaffolding crew leader (Alwin). They deliver letters to them. Alwin offers them a drink. The other scaffolders are still working.

There will be a walts on the 26th of the month

Recommending Ilmarinen

Game night! Friends of Alwin play games at a tavern. Drunk hide-and-seek.

Rircin and Urist can't find metals, so they'll keep on looking.


### Elidee and Norman talk with Landlord

> You look just like your mom. You must be recognized all the time.

Last time Elidee's mom was seen she was going to stop at the [[Fox and Goose]] and then at the castle. Oda might've been with her.

The fox-and-goose is south of the city of the south. Her mome went there before going to the forest of Toresterra before going to the rainbow hills.

> Coraline was really good at naming her child.

A map of locations has been provided to the players


### Amrynn scouting for cloth and shield colors

Amrynn goes to the wealthy side of the city.

Jumps out of a moving cart.

Survival check on 8. Don't know which part of the carriage to get out from. Hidhing place is moving. Amrynn looking to climb around the carrieage

After falling from the cart, a person confronts amrynn. The person knows amrynn but amrynn doesn't. He appears to be magically disguised.

They plan to meet tonight at a bar. With their right face.

### Xairan looking for info on imam

Xairan is walking around and showing the sigil of ??. People don't want to answer questions about the sigil.

Xairan would like to get bailys at a bar

Xairan is flirting with a 48 YO human. "I'm open for any night you're available"

Xairan got a job working at a bar at night from tomorrow


### Rircin and Urist go shopping

They find Ilmarinen. Ilmarinen specialize in forges. Ilmarinen doesn't know how large the forge will be or how it will be installed so they will go back to the house.

Rircin goes front to hide stuff at home looking for Amrynn. Amrynn is not home, so Rircin just cleaned it enough.


### Elidee and Norman following pike

They met Oba at the pike. They remember eachother despite meeting Elidee very young.

The mom went to the fox-and-goose. They lost track of eachother since. Oba's partner hasn't been back. He was the last person that must know about Elidee's mom.

Norman and Elidee go for ice cream.

Norman goes ahead to the house.

Elidee hangs around until closing time at the bar. The plan is to follow her around after the night.


### Amrynn goes back home

Went to the second house to spot for the area for changes. A bad investigation roll keeps her distracted.

Goes back to home to try and find calm

Urist tells Amrynn that they haven't been able to find metals
